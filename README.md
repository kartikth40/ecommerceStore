## Reflection


This was a 4 months long project built during my third year of College. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point by myself from different resources and familiarizing myself with documentations for new features.  

Originally I just wanted to make its frontend part only in order to practice and improve my front end skills but my curiosity made me to work upon making it fully usable with the help of full fledged backend.   

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to time constraints, I had to use firebase authentication for easy management without dealing with complex authentication strategies and focus more on making this project more and more functional with every day I spent on it.

At the end of the day, the basic technologies implemented in this project are `React`, `React-Router`, `Redux`, `firebase`, `mongodb`, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on making this website mobile friendly and implementing some good UX methods to make it simple and attractive.
